<h1 id="our-god">Our God</h1>

<p>Water You turned into wine <br>
Opened the eyes of the blind <br>
There's no one like You <br>
None like You</p>

<p>Into the darkness You shine <br>
Out of the ashes we rise <br>
There's no one like You <br>
None like You</p>

<p>CHORUS <br>
Our God is greater, our God is stronger <br>
God You are higher than any other <br>
Our God is Healer, awesome in power <br>
Our God, Our God... </p>

<p>Into the darkness You shine <br>
Out of the ashes we rise <br>

None like You</p>

<p>Our God is greater, our God is stronger <br>
God You are higher than any other <br>
Our God is Healer, awesome in power <br>
Our God, Our God...  <br>

<p>BRIDGE <br>
And if our God is for us, then who could ever stop us <br>
And if our God is with us, then what can stand against? <br>
And if our God is for us, then who could ever stop us <br>
And if our God is with us, then what can stand against? <br>
Then what can stand against?</p><div class="se-section-delimiter"></div>

<p>You are forever in my life <br>
You see me through the seasons <br>
Cover me with Your hand <br>
And lead me in Your righteousness</p>

<p>And I look to You <br>
And I wait on You</p>

<p>I'll sing to You Lord <br>
A hymn of love <br>
For Your faithfulness to me <br>
I'm carried in everlasting arms <br>
You never let me go <br>
Through it all</p>

<p>Hallelujah, Hallelujah <br>
Hallelujah, Hallelujah</p>

<p>Holy Lord, most holy Lord <br>
You alone are worthy <br>
Of all praise</p>

With all of my heart <br>
I'll sing</p>

<p>Great are You Lord <br>
Worthy of praise <br>
Holy and true <br>
Great are You Lord <br>
Most holy Lord</p><div class="se-section-delimiter"></div>

<h1 id="you-laid-aside-your-majesty">You Laid Aside Your Majesty</h1>

<p>You laid aside Your majesty <br>
Gave up everything for me <br>
Suffered at the hands <br>
Of those You had created</p>

<p>You took away my guilt and shame <br>
When You died and rose again <br>
Now today You reign <br>
And heaven and earth exalt You</p>

<p>I really want to worship You my Lord <br>
You have won my heart and I am Yours <br>
Forever and ever, I will love You <br>
You are the only one who died for me <br>
Gave Your life to set me free <br>
So I lift my voice to You in adoration</p><div class="se-section-delimiter"></div>

<h1 id="christ-is-enough">Christ is Enough</h1>

<p>VERSE <br>
Christ is my reward <br>
And all of my devotion <br>
Now there's nothing in this world <br>
That could ever satisfy</p>

<p>PRE-CHORUS <br>
Through every trial <br>
My soul will sing <br>
No turning back <br>
I've been set free</p>

<p>CHORUS <br>
Christ is enough for me <br>
Christ is enough for me <br>
Everything I need is in You <br>
Everything I need</p>

<p>VERSE <br>

The joy of my salvation <br>
And this hope will never fail <br>
Heaven is our home</p>

<p>PRE-CHORUS <br>
Through every storm <br>
My soul will sing <br>
Jesus is here <br>
To God be the glory</p>

<p>BRIDGE <br>
I have decided to follow Jesus <br>
No turning back <br>
No turning back</p>

<p>The cross before me <br>
The world behind me <br>
No turning back <br>
No turning back</p>
