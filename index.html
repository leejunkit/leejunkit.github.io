<h2 id="desert-song">Desert Song</h2>

<p>This is my prayer in the desert <br>
When all that's within me feels dry <br>
This is my prayer in my hunger and need <br>
My God is the God who provides</p>

<p>This is my prayer in the fire <br>
In weakness or trial or pain <br>
There is a faith proved to more worth than gold <br>
So refine me Lord through the flame</p>

<p><strong>Chorus</strong> <br>
I will bring praise <br>
I will bring praise <br>
No weapon formed against me shall remain <br>
I will rejoice <br>
I will declare <br>
God is my victory and He is here</p>

<p>This is my prayer in the battle <br>
When triumph is still on its way <br>
I am a conqueror and co-heir with Christ <br>
So firm on His promise I'll stand</p>

<p><strong>Bridge</strong> <br>
All of my life <br>
In every season <br>
You are still God <br>
I have a reason to sing <br>
I have a reason to worship</p><div class="se-section-delimiter"></div>

<h2 id="10000-reasons">10,000 Reasons</h2>

<p><strong>Chorus</strong> <br>
Bless the Lord, oh my soul <br>
Oh my soul <br>
Worship His holy name <br>
Sing like never before <br>
Oh my soul <br>
I worship Your holy name</p>

<p>The sun comes up <br>
It's a new day dawning <br>
It's time to sing Your song again <br>
Whatever may pass <br>
And whatever lies before me <br>
Let me be singing when the evening comes</p>

<p>You're rich in love <br>
And You're slow to anger <br>
Your name is great <br>
And Your heart is kind <br>
For all Your goodness I will keep on singing <br>
Ten thousand reasons for my heart to find</p>

<p>And on that day <br>
When my strength is failing <br>
The end draws near <br>
And my time has come <br>
Still my soul will sing Your praise unending <br>
Ten thousand years and then forevermore</p><div class="se-section-delimiter"></div>

<h2 id="your-presence-is-heaven">Your Presence Is Heaven</h2>

<p>Who is like You Lord in all the earth <br>
Matchless love and beauty <br>
Endless worth <br>
Nothing in this world will satisfy <br>
Jesus You're the cup that won't run dry</p>

<p>Your presence is heaven to me <br>
Your presence is heaven to me</p>

<p>Treasure of my heart and of my soul <br>
In my weakness You are merciful <br>
Redeemer of my past and present wrongs <br>
Holder of my future days to come</p>

<p>Your presence is heaven to me <br>
Your presence is heaven to me</p>

<p><strong>Chorus</strong> <br>
Oh Jesus, Oh Jesus <br>
Your presence is heaven to me <br>
Oh Jesus, Oh Jesus <br>
Your presence is heaven to me</p>

<p>So all my days on earth I will await <br>
The moment that I see You face to face <br>
Nothing in this world will satisfy <br>
Jesus You're the cup that won't run dry <br>
Nothing in this world will satisfy <br>
Jesus You're the cup that won't run dry</p><div class="se-section-delimiter"></div>

<h2 id="how-he-loves">How He Loves</h2>

<p>He is jealous for me <br>
Love's like a hurricane <br>
I am a tree <br>
Bending beneath the weight of His wind and mercy</p>

<p>When all of a sudden <br>
I am unaware <br>
Of these afflictions eclipsed by glory <br>
And I realise just how beautiful You are <br>
And how great Your affections are for me</p>

<p>And oh, how He loves us so <br>
Oh, how He loves us <br>
How He loves us so</p>

<p><strong>Chorus</strong> <br>
Yeah He loves us <br>
Oh how He loves us <br>
Oh how He loves us <br>
Oh how He loves</p>

<p>We are His portion <br>
And He is our prize <br>
Drawn to redemption by the grace in His eyes <br>
If grace is an ocean <br>
We're all sinking <br>
So Heaven meets Earth like a sloppy wet kiss <br>
And my heart turns violently inside of my chest <br>
I don't have time to make plain these regrets <br>
When I think about the way</p>
