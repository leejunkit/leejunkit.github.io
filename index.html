<h1 id="the-stand">The Stand</h1>

<p>You stood before creation <br>
Eternity in Your hand <br>
You spoke all life into motion <br>
My soul now to stand</p>

<p>You stood before my failure <br>
Carried the Cross for my shame <br>
My sin weighed upon Your shoulders <br>
My soul now to stand</p>

<p>So what can I say? <br>
What can I do? <br>
But offer this heart O God <br>
Completely to You</p>

<p>So I’ll walk upon salvation <br>
Your Spirit alive in me <br>
This life to declare Your promise <br>
My soul now to stand</p>

<p>So what can I say? <br>
What can I do? <br>
But offer this heart O God <br>
Completely to You</p>

<p>So I’ll stand with arms high and heart abandoned <br>
In awe of the One who gave it all <br>
So I’ll stand, my soul Lord to You surrendered <br>
All I am is Yours</p>

<h1 id="anchor">Anchor</h1>

<p>I have this hope <br>
As an anchor for my soul <br>
Through every storm <br>
I will hold to You</p>

<p>With endless love <br>
All my fear is swept away <br>
In everything <br>
I will trust in You</p>

<p>There is hope in the promise of the cross <br>
You gave everything to save the world You loved <br>
And this hope is an anchor for my soul <br>
Our God will stand <br>
Unshakable</p>

<p>Unchanging One <br>
You who was and is to come <br>
Your promise sure <br>
You will not let go</p>

<p>There is hope in the promise of the cross <br>
You gave everything to save the world You loved <br>
And this hope is an anchor for my soul <br>
Our God will stand <br>
Unshakable</p>

<p>Your name is higher <br>
Your name is greater <br>
All my hope is in You</p>

<p>Your word unfailing <br>
Your promise unshaken <br>
All my hope is in You</p><div class="se-section-delimiter"></div>

<h1 id="hide-me-in-the-shelter">Hide Me in the Shelter</h1>

<p>Under the shadow of Your wings <br>
Here in the secret place of Your holiness <br>
I will wait on You, oh Lord, my God and King</p>

<p>Here in the Holiest of all <br>
You draw me near with love to abandon all <br>
For the sake of knowing You, my God and King</p>

<p>Hide me in the shelter of Your love <br>
Deep in the center of Your heart, my Lord <br>
How I want to know You more <br>
And keep me in the shadow of Your wings <br>
Safe in the secret place of holiness <br>
How I want to know You more</p>

<p>Hide me, oh Lord <br>
And keep me, oh Lord <br>
Safe in the secret place <br>
Safe in the secret place</p>

<h1 id="in-whom-i-can-trust">In Whom I Can Trust</h1>

<p>You are the Lord <br>
In whom I can trust <br>
You are the Rock I can stand upon <br>
Every step of the way <br>
You take my hand and say <br>
You will always be here right beside me <br>
When I call on You I know You’ll come to me</p>

<p>You are my Lord <br>
In whom I can trust <br>
You are my fortress <br>
You’re my deliverer <br>
My shield <br>
My strength</p>

<p>For all of my days <br>
My hope is in You, Jesus <br>
You love me with Your life <br>
The rock of my salvation <br>
In Whom I can trust</p>
