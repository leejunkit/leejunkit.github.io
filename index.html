<h3 id="victors-crown">Victor's Crown</h3>

<p>You are always fighting for us <br>
Heaven's angels all around <br>
My delight is found in knowing <br>
That You wear the Victor's crown</p>

<p>You're my help and my defender <br>
You're my Saviour and my friend <br>
By Your grace I live and breathe <br>
To worship You</p>

<p>At the mention of Your greatness <br>
In Your name I will bow down <br>
In Your presence fear is silent <br>
For You wear the Victor's crown</p>

<p>Let Your glory fill this temple <br>
Let Your power overflow <br>
By Your grace I live and breathe <br>
To worship You</p>

<p><strong>Chorus</strong> <br>
Hallelujah <br>
You have overcome <br>
You have overcome <br>
Hallelujah <br>
Jesus You have overcome the world</p>

<p>You are ever interceding <br>
As the lost become the found <br>
You can never be defeated <br>
For You wear the Victor's crown</p>

<p>You are Jesus the Messiah <br>
You're the hope of all the world <br>
By Your grace I live and breathe <br>
To worship You</p>

<p><strong>Bridge</strong> <br>
Every high thing must come down <br>
Every stronghold shall be broken <br>
You wear the Victor's crown <br>
You overcome, You overcome</p>

<p>At the cross the work was finished <br>
You were buried in the ground <br>
But the grave could not contain You <br>
For You wear the Victor's crown</p>

<h3 id="man-of-sorrows">Man of Sorrows</h3>

<p>Man of sorrows, Lamb of God <br>
By His own betrayed <br>
The sin of man and wrath of God <br>
Has been on Jesus laid</p>

<p>Silent as He stood accused <br>
Beaten, mocked and scorned <br>
Bowing to the Father's will <br>
He took the crown of thorns</p>

<p><strong>Chorus</strong> <br>
Oh that rugged cross  <br>
My salvation <br>
Where Your love poured out <br>
Over me <br>
Now my soul cries out <br>
Hallelujah <br>
Praise and honour unto thee</p>

<p>Sent of Heaven, God's own Son <br>
To purchase and redeem <br>
And reconcile the very ones <br>
Who nailed Him to that tree</p>

<p><strong>Bridge</strong>  <br>
Now my debt is paid <br>
It is paid in full <br>
By the precious blood <br>
That my Jesus spilt</p>

<p>Now the curse of sin <br>
Has no hold on me <br>
Whom the Son sets free <br>
Oh is free indeed</p>

<p>See the stone is rolled away <br>
Behold the empty tomb <br>
Hallelujah God be praised <br>
He's risen from the grave </p><div class="se-section-delimiter"></div>

<h3 id="i-exalt-thee">I Exalt Thee</h3>

<p>I exalt thee <br>
I exalt thee <br>
I exalt thee <br>
Oh Lord</p>

<p>For thou oh Lord art high <br>
Above all the earth <br>
Thou art exalted <br>
Far above all gods</p>

<p>For thou oh Lord art high <br>
Above all the earth <br>
Thou art exalted <br>
Far above all gods</p><div class="se-section-delimiter"></div>

<h3 id="in-the-presence-of-jehovah">In The Presence of Jehovah</h3>

<p>In the presence <br>
of Jehovah <br>
God almighty <br>
Prince of peace <br>
Troubles vanish <br>
Hearts are mended <br>
In the presence of the King</p><div class="se-section-delimiter"></div>

<h3 id="this-is-our-god">This is our God</h3>

<p>Your grace is enough <br>
more than I need <br>
At Your word  <br>
I will believe</p>

<p>I wait for You <br>
draw near again <br>
Let Your Spirit make me new</p>

<p>Your presence in me <br>
Jesus light the way <br>
By the power of Your word</p>

<p>I am restored <br>
I am redeemed <br>
By Your Spirit I am free</p>

<p>And I will fall at Your feet <br>
I will fall at Your feet <br>
And I will worship You here</p>

<p><strong>Chorus</strong>  <br>
Freely You gave it all for us <br>
Surrendered Your life  <br>
Upon that cross <br>
Great is the love  <br>
Poured out for all <br>
This is our God</p>

<p>Lifted on high  <br>
From death to life <br>
Forever our God is glorified <br>
Servant and King  <br>
Rescued the world <br>
This is our God</p><div class="se-section-delimiter"></div>

<h3 id="jesus-it-is-you">Jesus It Is You</h3>

<p>Who makes the sun to rise <br>
And brings the earth new light <br>
In every beam <br>
Jesus it is You</p>

<p>Who turns the day to night <br>
And watches me as I begin to dream <br>
Jesus it is You</p>

<p>Who brings me food for my table <br>
Who cares for all of my needs <br>
Who walks the road with me <br>
Has grown with me through all <br>
That I have been <br>
Jesus it is You <br>
Jesus it is You</p>

<p><strong>Chorus</strong> <br>
I lift my hands <br>
I bring my song <br>
All of my days <br>
All of my rights <br>
All of my wrongs <br>
I offer my life <br>
Here and beyond <br>
To the one thing true <br>
Jesus it is You</p>

<p>Who sees my brokeness <br>
And carries me when I  <br>
Am frail and weak <br>
Jesus it is You</p>

<p>Who tells the storm to rest <br>
When I am overwhelmed <br>
And cannot speak <br>
Jesus it is You</p>

<p>Who wears my guilt on His shoulders <br>
Who holds my heart in His hands <br>
Who takes my thoughts and fears <br>
And hangs them on the arms <br>
Of calvary <br>
Jesus it is You <br>
Jesus it is You</p>
