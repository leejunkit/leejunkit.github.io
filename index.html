		<h1 id="nooneelse">No One Else</h1>

		<p>Lord, it's only by Your grace <br />
		That I can worship in this place <br />
		Oh, what a great privilege <br />
		To know you <br />
		Face to face</p>

		<p>There is no one else but You <br />
		No one else as beautiful as You <br />
		No one else can compare to You <br />
		All I want is to worship You</p>

		<h1 id="howgreatthouart">How Great Thou Art</h1>

		<p>Oh Lord my God <br />
		When I, in awesome wonder <br />
		Consider all the works thy hands have made <br />
		I see the stars <br />
		I hear the rolling thunder <br />
		Thy pow'r throughout <br />
		The universe displayed</p>

		<p>Then sings my soul <br />
		My Saviour God to Thee <br />
		How great thou art <br />
		How great thou art  </p>

		<p>Then sings my soul <br />
		My Saviour God to Thee <br />
		How great thou art <br />
		How great thou art</p>

		<h1 id="sweeterthanwine">Sweeter Than Wine</h1>

		<p>Before the earth's creation <br />
		You knew me as I was <br />
		And even then You chose me to be Yours <br />
		I am captivated <br />
		By Your unending love <br />
		Lord my heart's surrendered to Your grace  </p>

		<p>And I can't help <br />
		But to lift my voice and say  </p>

		<p>Your love is better than life <br />
		Sweeter than wine <br />
		It's more than I can ever imagine <br />
		Your love is all that I need <br />
		So Lord I receive <br />
		Your lovingkindness and grace <br />
		For me</p>

		<p>Lord I am Your treasure <br />
		The apple of Your eye <br />
		Forever I am precious in Your sight <br />
		Never will You leave me <br />
		I'm safe and secure <br />
		Forever in Your arms I will abide</p>

		<h1 id="theloveofgod">The Love Of God</h1>

		<p>The love of God is greater far <br />
		Than tongue or pen could ever tell <br />
		It goes beyond the highest star <br />
		And reaches to the lowest hell <br />
		The guilty pair bowed down with care <br />
		God gave His son to win <br />
		His erring child he reconciled <br />
		And pardoned from his sin</p>

		<p>Oh love of God, how rich and pure <br />
		How measureless and strong <br />
		It shall forevermore endure <br />
		The saints and angels' song</p>

		<p>Could we with ink the oceans fill <br />
		And were the skies of parchment made <br />
		Were every stalk on earth a quill <br />
		And every man a scribe by trade <br />
		To write the love of God above <br />
		Would drain the oceans dry <br />
		Nor could the scroll contain the whole <br />
		Though stretched from sky to sky</p>
